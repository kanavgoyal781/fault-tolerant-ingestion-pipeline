    "text": "DEAR MISS MANNERS: A very long time ago, my husband and I were invited to dinner at a restaurant by a colleague of his. I had not met the colleague or his wife prior to the dinner.  The men promised they wouldn’t talk shop, but they did -- throughout the entire meal. There was no inclusion of us women. I tried to initiate a conversation with the wife, and she shut me down immediately with something along the lines of, “I’d rather listen to what the men are talking about.” Gobsmacked, I just shrank back in the seat and ate my dinner. As my husband and I were leaving, I told him what had happened and he (rightfully) said that we’d never do that again. I should have gotten over this by now, but I fantasize about having left the table in some way. What should I have done? I didn’t want to be rude myself. GENTLE READER: Are you talking about a very, VERY long time ago? Because Miss Manners remembers those days -- when wives, if invited at all, were treated as table decorations to be talked around.  But didn’t we have a successful rebellion against that?  Apparently not successful enough, if it is now a wife who treats her guest like that. She need only have said, apologetically, “Sorry, I’m listening to them.” There is no need for you to fantasize about reacting effectively, and yet not rudely, because you already did: first by your silence, and then by your and your husband’s resolving never to socialize with them again.  ***\n(Please send your questions to Miss Manners at her website,\nwww.missmanners.com\n; to her email,\ndearmissmanners@gmail.com\n; or through postal mail to Miss Manners, Andrews McMeel Syndication, 1130 Walnut St., Kansas City, MO 64106.)",

    "text": "TORONTO\n—\nJ.C. Escarra\nfeels personally responsible for the\nYankees’ 12-5 loss\nto the Blue Jays on Tuesday, a game-changing catcher’s interference on a check swing.\nYankees\nmanager Aaron Boone blamed the mistake on a rule that he feels MLB ought to change. Reliever Luke Weaver, who allowed five seventh-inning rules immediately after the E2, agrees with his skipper. With two on and one out in the seventh inning of a tie game, the rookie catcher knows that he was too aggressive trying to frame a 3-2 fastball from Luke Weaver that already was a framed strike. Plate umpire Doug Eddings rung up pinch-hitter Addison Barger, but while checking his swing his bat clipped Escarra’s catcher’s mitt. The Blue Jays asked for replay challenge to overturn the strikeout, won and wound up with the bases loaded and one out instead of two on with two down when Escarra was charged with a second catcher’s interference call in two days. “It’s on me,” Escarra said. “I intend to get as close as possible, but obviously not letting that happen. I was too close. I didn’t help my team win today … or yesterday. “It shouldn’t happen, but it’s something I can control. I was just too deep in there trying to steal that strike.” Boone says the Yankees relentlessly prepare to avoid catcher’s interference by knowing which hitters are more prone to hitting a catcher’s mitt with a swing during framing situations. “We’re incredibly diligent on trying to eliminate that as much as possible,” Boone said. “I don’t know how many times it’s happened to us this year in the first three months. “It is something that we lean into every hitter. Who are we vulnerable with? Who are we not? We’ve met and we do that accordingly with our catchers.” What bothered Boone is that this one occurred when Barger didn’t even swing. “We benefited from a check swing last year,” Boone said. “I forget the game, but there should probably be something looked into that where a check swing can’t get you beat like that.” Weaver feels the same. “It’s pretty devastating, honestly,” he said. “I feel like that’s a really unfortunate part of our game. I don’t really personally think that belongs in our game. I think there should be some type of discretion to it. “I understand that there are moments where it’s very egregious and (batters) hit the glove on a full swing, but you feel like you earned something there and it was taken from you and it’s out of my control at that point. “Just a real silly thing to happen.” After it happened, the floodgates opened with the tie-breaking hit by Clement and then the grand slam by Springer, who had a great day going 3-for-4 with two homers and seven RBI. “I’m trying to get the groundball on the next pitch (to Clement) and it just finds the hole, then you run into a bad pitch there a guy that’s having a nice day and the game gets away from you.” The Blue Jays taking over the game after the catcher’s interference sickened Escarra. “Exactly,” he said. “It gave them bases loaded and the big hit came. I could have prevented it, so it was in my control.”\nYankees -1.5 runline is +128 on\nDraftKings\nfor Wednesday’s game against the Blue Jays. Our comprehensive\nDraftKings Sportsbook review\nwill show you how to sign up and get started.\nEscarra says that he’s never had a problem with catcher’s interference calls until the last two days. “No,” he said. “It’s just trying to get the glove in the zone. If the pitch is out of the zone, I’m just trying to move it as fast as possible up and forward to steal that strike, to make it look like a strike to the umpire. “He wasn’t going to swing, but at the end of the day I shouldn’t have been too close like that. “Going forward, I’ve really got to make it a priority to not get in too deep in there.”\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

    "text": "On Wednesday at 2:51 a.m. the National Weather Service issued an updated flood warning in effect until 7 a.m. for Monmouth and Ocean counties. The weather service states, \"Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected for portions of central and southern New Jersey, including in central New Jersey, Monmouth counties. In southern New Jersey, Ocean.\" \"Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring,\" explains the weather service. \"Don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles.\" A flash flood warning is issued when a flash flood is either imminent or already occurring. In flood-prone areas, it's crucial to move immediately to higher ground. A flash flood is a sudden and violent inundation that can develop within minutes to hours, and it can even happen in areas not currently experiencing rainfall. A flood warning is declared when flooding is on the verge of happening or is already underway. A flood advisory is released when flooding is not expected to reach a severity level necessitating a warning. Nonetheless, it can still cause considerable inconvenience and, without exercising caution, potentially lead to situations that threaten life and/or property. A flood watch is issued when conditions are favorable for flooding. It does not mean flooding will occur, but it is possible. Floods can pose a significant threat, especially if you live in a flood-prone area or find yourself camping in a low-lying region. To ensure your safety, the weather service offers essential flood safety guidelines:\nMove to higher ground:\nIf you reside in a flood-prone region or are camping in low-lying terrain, the first step to safety is relocating to higher ground.\nFollow evacuation orders:\nIf local authorities issue an evacuation order, heed it promptly. Prior to leaving, secure your home by locking it.\nDisconnect utilities and appliances:\nIf time permits, disconnect your utilities and appliances. This precaution minimizes electrical hazards during flooding.\nAvoid basements and submerged areas:\nAvoid basements or rooms submerged in water with electrical outlets or cords. Preventing electrical accidents is crucial.\nSwift evacuation for your safety:\nIf you notice sparks or hear buzzing, crackling, snapping, or popping noises, evacuate immediately. Avoid any water that may be charged with electricity.\nStay away from floodwaters:\nNever attempt to walk through floodwaters, even if they appear shallow. Just 6 inches of fast-moving water can forcefully sweep you off your feet.\nSeek high ground if trapped:\nShould you become trapped by moving water, reach the highest point possible and dial 911 to contact emergency services. During heavy rainfall, the risk of flooding is heightened, especially in low-lying and flood-prone regions. Always remember never to drive through water on the road, no matter how shallow it appears. According to the weather service, as little as 12 inches of rapidly flowing water can carry away most vehicles. Prioritize your safety by staying informed and prepared. Rain can turn roads into hazards. Stay informed and follow these tips from the weather service to ensure safety during heavy rainfall:\nBeware of swollen waterways:\nDuring heavy rain, avoid parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a serious risk.\nMaintain safe driving distances:\nAdhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness.\nReduce speed and drive cautiously:\nOn wet roads, slowing down is paramount. Gradually ease off the accelerator and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.\nChoose your lane wisely:\nStay toward the middle lanes - water tends to pool in the outside lanes.\nVisibility matters:\nTurn on your headlights and be careful of other vehicles to the rear and in blind spot areas as they are especially difficult to see through rain-spattered windows.\nWatch out for slippery roads:\nThe first half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mix of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period.\nKeep a safe distance from large vehicles:\nDon't follow large trucks or buses too closely. The spray created by their large tires reduces your vision. Take care when passing them as well; if you must pass, do so quickly and safely.\nMind your windshield wipers:\nBy following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.",

I have mentioned it before, but it didn’t stick. This is the only problem with our relationship. I don’t want to hurt his feelings or make either one of us uncomfortable, but he’s just not getting the job done. -- WORKING ON IT IN TENNESSEE DEAR WORKING: I will assume that the man of your dreams loves you and wants to take care of you. Although this may be a difficult topic to address, communication is very important. Ask your doctor or gynecologist for a referral to a licensed sex therapist, then tell the man you love you would like him to accompany you. If he loves you, he will go and learn something. If his ego gets in the way, have the conversation about what you need at a time when you are both calm and relaxed, and communication is easier -- NOT in the bedroom. ***\nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

    "text": "Spotify has come under fire for not labeling\nAI-generated music\nthat has recently flooded the streaming service.  San Francisco indie rock band Deerhoof is taking things a step further in protest of the co-founder and chief executive officer, Daniel Ek’s, investment in an AI military company.  In a statement released on the band’s\nInstagram\naccount on Monday, Deerhoof announced they will be pulling their entire 20-album discography from Spotify.  “‘Daniel Ek uses $700 million of his Spotify fortune to become chairman of AI battle tech company’ was not a headline we enjoyed reading this week,” the band wrote. “We don’t want our music killing people. We don’t want our success being tied to AI battle tech.”  Ek himself is the founder of an investment fund named\nPrima Materia\n. In June, Prima Materia led an effort to raise € 600 million ($693.6 million) for Helsing, a defense company specializing in the sale of software utilizing AI to inform tactical decisions, as reported by\nCNBC.\nEk joined the company board in 2021 and was later named chairman last month.  NJ Advance Media has reached out to Spotify for comment.  The members of Deerhoof also stated that they were entering a strategic partnership with DoorDash\nas a joke\nand that the band made more money from touring anyway. They later levied a critique of Spotify’s overall experience for both users and musicians.  “Spotify is flushing itself down the toilet,” the band said. “Eventually artists will want to leave this already widely hated data-mining scam masquerading as a ‘music company.’ It’s creepy for users and crappy for artists. Music-making lasts forever, but this or that digital get-rich-quick scheme is sure to become obsolete.” As far as the takedowns are concerned, labels the band has worked with, such as Kill Rock Stars and Polyvinyl, will have to request Deerhoof’s music to be removed.  “The grunt work of pulling content off of Spotify is something they’re now tasked with, and they are sharing the financial hit, the band wrote, “We know we are asking them to make a sacrifice, and it means a lot to us.” Joyful Noise Recordings, the label which has aided in the release of Deerhoof’s last six albums,\nreleased a statement\nin support of the band’s move.  “As an independent record label, we serve the artist,” Joyful Noise wrote. “It is ultimately their decision to present their material on whichever platforms they choose. It is with this in mind that we hold no judgment towards any artist that wishes to keep their music on the platform.”\nOur journalism needs your support.

    "text": "DEAR MISS MANNERS: My husband’s cousin and her husband live a few miles away from us. While their parents were fairly close when the cousins were growing up, the cousins themselves didn’t maintain contact once they became adults. I enjoy sending greeting cards for birthdays, anniversaries, holidays and so on, and this cousin is on my list. We’re also friends on social media. She messages me and suggests that we get together for lunch sometime, but offers no specific details.

    "text": "TORONTO\n— If you were watching Tuesday when often-unhittable\nYankees\nace Max Fried was shellacked for four fourth-inning runs on two homers, you saw how the Blue Jays’ big blow was set up. After a leadoff homer by George Springer and then two outs, Davis Schneider hit a chopper to third base that should have had the Yankees off the field up a run.\nJazz Chisholm\nhustled in to field the grounder on two hops, then whipped an off-balance throw to first that was way off target. First baseman Paul Goldschmidt had to leave the bag to catch the throw, which was five feet to the home plate side of first, and the Blue Jays had a two-out baserunner on a fairly routine groundball that should have been scored an error but gifted Schneider a cheap hit. Watching this play out, did you say for the umpteenth time in the last month: Why the hell did the Yankees move Chisholm from second base to third last month? When a walk to Miles Straw and then a Andres Giminez three-run homer to dead center followed Chisholm’s mess up, the Blue Jays were up two runs in a Canada Day matinee that\nToronto won 12-5\nto get to within one game of the first-place Yanks. This 12th Yankees defeat in their last 18 games again showed they’re a ballclub with problems that need addressed. They need bullpen help, they’ve hit a dreadful .118 with runners in scoring potion over their last 19 games,\nAnthony Volpe\nnow has fielding woes in addition to inconsistent hitting and … The Yankees need to flip Chisholm and second baseman DJ LeMahieu immediately, And then general manager Brian Cashman needs to make it a mission to deal for a better third baseman before the July 31 trade deadline. It makes no sense why Chisholm was pulled off second in the first place. That’s his best position by far. He’s good there. He’s not good at third. Chisholm would rather play second, too, but he’s all about whatever’s best for the team, so he’ll play wherever with no complaints. And while LeMahieu won Gold Gloves in his heyday and has done OK there since he started his season in mid-May, he’ll be 36 on July 13 ... an old 36. LeMahieu just doesn’t have close to the range that Chisholm has there. Also, LeMahieu showed that he can handle third during those rare occasions when he was off the IL the last few seasons. Chisholm has been charged with only three errors in his 25 games at third base, all since June 3, but he’s botched a few plays that were scored hits. He even looks like a fish out of water at third. Why switch? The Yankees probably were catering to LeMahieu because they’re desperate to get some payback for the $15 million that he’ll make annually this year and again in 2026, mercifully the last season of a six-year, $90-million contract that hasn’t worked out at all. This might not have been manager Aaron Boone’s decision, either. The wild guess here is that Yankees management and/or their analytics department’s fingerprints are on this because Boone hasn’t given a good answer when he was asked why Chisholm was pulled off second. But now that it’s very apparent that Chisholm needs to return to second, it needs to happen. After Tuesday’s game, Boone was asked if there will be consideration returning Chisholm to second and playing LeMahieu at third. “We’ll talk through that stuff,” Boone responded. “I think both guys are really talented defenders wherever they line up, but we’ll continue to look at things like that.” That answer was telling. Taking a stab on what’s going on privately, the Yankees perhaps have been seriously thinking of making this switch. Or maybe Boone and his coaching staff are pushing for it to happen. If Chisholm goes back to second, the Yankees immediately become much better up the middle because he’s the better defender. The Yankees then still would need to address third base because LeMahieu, like past season, again looks far beyond his prime years batting .250 with two homers and 11 RBI in 40 games. The Yankees weren’t expecting LeMahieu to hit this season like he did when he won two batting championships, but they were hoping for more offensive impact than they’re getting. Maybe LeMahieu will stay off the IL, get hot and hit in the high .200s because he’s only being judged now on 116 at-bats. If it does, it couldn’t happen to a better guy. But he’s just not passing the eye test often enough to warrant regular at-bats. Unfortunately for the Yankees, reserve infielder Oswald Peraza isn’t the answer, either. He can pick it anywhere in the infield as well as almost anyone, but the bat never has come around and it’s probably time to cut the cord on a one-time elite prospect who hasn’t panned out. In the coming weeks, the pressure will be on Cashman to improve the Yankees’ roster because returning to the World Series is there for the taking with only the AL Central-power Tigers, AL West-leading Astros and maybe AL East rival Blue Jays and Rays in their way. Cashman surely will add one or two bullpen arms, the expected August return of Luis Gil should give the rotation a big boost and a right-handed bat with power may be brought in to get left field starts because rookie switch-hitter Jasson Dominguez is much better now from the left side. Third base? If Chisholm does go back to second, Cashman’s best available play would be trading with the Diamondbacks for star third baseman Eugenio Suarez, who is have a great season. At age 33, he’s among the NL homer (26) and RBI (69) leaders while hitting a respectable .254 and playing a solid third base. In addition to Suarez’s bat and fielding being very attractive, his contract is, too. The Venezuelan is making $15 million in his walk season to free agency. There probably will be a lot of competition for Suarez assuming the 43-42 Diamondbacks are sellers. For sure, they’d demand Cashman’s offer include Yankees No. 1 prospect George Lombard Jr., a 20-year-old Double-A shortstop who has star potential. That won’t happen, but the Diamondbacks might take No. 2 prospect Spencer Jones, a 6-foot-7 center fielder who just recently went to Triple-A, plus one of the SEC arms that was drafted early last summer. Whatever happens at the deadline, the Yankees can improve NOW by putting Chisholm back where he belongs ... second base.\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

    "text": "The Phillies’ game with the San Diego Padres Tuesday night\nwas postponed\nand rescheduled as a day-night doubleheader Wednesday, a fitting way to celebrate the 32nd anniversary of perhaps the most peculiar twin bill in the history of the franchise. On July 2, 1993, the\nPhillies\nand Padres played what they used to call a twi-night doubleheader with the first game scheduled for 4:35 p.m. (it was delayed nine minutes by rain) and the second game scheduled to begin about 20 minutes after the first one. The second game ended at 4:40 a.m., which remains the latest a major-league game has ever ended. Fireworks, as they are again Wednesday at Citizens Bank Park, were also in the plans after the two games at Veterans Stadium more than three decades ago. Nothing went as planned.  The first game only took 2 hours and 34 minutes, but it didn’t end until after 1 a.m. because of three different rain delays that lasted 5 hours and 54 minutes. At the time, there were no rules about how late the second game could start. Crew chief Dana DeMuth said play ball and Jose DeLeon threw the first pitch at 1:28 a.m.\nMitch Williams,\nthe Phillies’ closer known for his violent fall-off-the-mound delivery and often chaotic ninth innings, would eventually emerge as the unlikely hero who ended the 12-hour marathon, but he spent most of the crazy event as a spectator. He had hoped to have a role in one of the games because his father and stepmother had flown in from Oregon that day to see him pitch. “They had flew all day from Oregon,” Williams told NJ Advance Media via telephone Tuesday from his Texas home. Williams didn’t pitch in the first game, a 5-2 Phillies loss and his stepmother left in the middle of the third and final rain delay with Williams’ wife Irene. When the game ended, Williams met his father outside the clubhouse and informed him the second game would start in 20 minutes. “He said, ‘It might start for you, but I’m done,’ ” Williams said. “He said, ‘Give me the keys to your truck. I had like a queen size bed in the back of my truck.” Around 4 a.m., Irene Williams got a call from her mother Pat at home in Moorestown. “She says, ‘Irene, I know you’re sleeping ... but Mitch is about to come up and bat,’ ” Williams’ wife remembered Tuesday. “I was like, ‘Mom, what are you talking about? You know it’s four o’clock in the morning.’ She said, ‘Turn on the TV, they’re still playing.” Williams, after pitching two scoreless innings, was told by manager Jim Fregosi before the bottom of the 10th inning of Game 2 that his evening as a pitcher was over, but that he’d have to hit if his spot came up in the order because the Phillies were out of position players. Fregosi had also burned his two best hitting pitchers — Tommy Greene and David West. Sure enough, Williams’ turn in the order came up. “A lot of people who knew me knew that all I wanted to do was hit,” Williams said. “I loved taking BP and I always wanted to get into a game and hit. I lived to do that. I used to pay people to throw me BP.” That doesn’t mean he was an especially good hitter. He finished his career with three hits (one was a three-run homer off the Mets’ Don Aase) in 17 plate appearances. With the birds chirping as dawn approached on this July night in South Philadelphia, Williams had the tall task of facing San Diego’s Trevor Hoffman, a rookie who had only accumulated two of what would become 601 career saves. Even then, however, he had one of the nastiest changeups in the game. “I remember going up to the plate and telling the catcher (Kevin Higgins) that if Trevor Hoffman threw me one changeup I was going to hit him in the head with a bat,” Williams said. Hoffman threw two fastballs and\nWilliams lined the second one into left-center field\nfor a game-winning single. Williams’ father slept through it all outside in the back of his son’s truck. “When I came out after the game he said, ‘Well, what happened?’ ” Williams said. “I said, ‘Ah nothing. I got the win in the second game and I hit a double in extra innings to win it.’ He says, ‘B.S.’ He couldn’t believe he was in the truck sleeping while it was going on.” The players in the Phillies’ clubhouse after that game were understandably exhausted and it was a sentiment felt throughout the stadium. “It’s been 50 years since I stayed out all night,” 73-year-old security guard Dewitt Hobbs told me that night.\nJohn Kruk\n, the best quote in the clubhouse, declined to speak because he said “I’m going to ice so I can get home before the sun rises.” It was a Saturday morning, so pitcher Terry Mulholland, who started the first game of the doubleheader, thought he might have to “wait for the shore traffic to die down” before he went home. The excitement wasn’t over for Williams and his father Jeff once they left the stadium. On his way back to South Jersey that morning, Williams was stopped by the police on the Betsy Ross Bridge. “My dad’s laying in the back and I get pulled over,” Williams said. “My dad is like, ‘What did you do?’ I said, ‘This guy just wants to talk to me about the game.’ And sure enough he came up and he says, ‘I was listening on the radio.’ I got pulled over 16 times in 1993 on the Betsy Ross Bridge just so they could talk to me about the game. They knew my teal-colored truck so every time I went over they’d pull me over.” It was an enchanted season for the Phillies, who spent all but one day in first place en route to a National League pennant that came courtesy of a six-game win over the Atlanta Braves in the National League Championship Series. Their championship dream was shattered by a series-ending home run by Joe Carter off Williams in Game 6 of the World Series inside Toronto’s SkyDome, but you got the feeling those Phillies would have a special connection that would last a lifetime. Reality has been much different and Williams is one of the Phillies estranged from his former team. Through the years, he has feuded with Curt Schilling and Lenny Dykstra and he did not attend the 30-year reunion for the 1993 team a couple seasons ago and he said the only former teammate he has kept in touch with is third baseman David Hollins. Williams, 60, lives in Hamilton Texas, which is about 120 miles southwest of Dallas and he’s raising pigs, chickens and goats with his wife Irene. “I haven’t watched a game or heard about a game in a long time,” Williams said. “I was kind of forced out of it. They didn’t want me to come to any of the reunions or anything. We were uninvited to the reunions except for the 30-year one. I can only get treated like crap for so long before you just walk away. At one point they wouldn’t let my family come and then they uninvited me.” Williams said the separation leaves him both sad and angry. “Yeah, I would have worked for that organization for the rest of my career,” he said. “They talk about Phillies’ family and everything, but we sure weren’t a part of it. It seemed like they hired everybody from that team to do something with the organization except me.I tried to get a job in broadcasting with them and they didn’t want any part of me there. When I was working at Comcast, I just wanted to do games and they wouldn’t let me do it.”\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

    "text": "NEW YORK —\nMets\nstarter\nGriffin Canning\nis already working on his recovery plan. Back in the Mets locker room at Citi Field after successfully undergoing surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles on Tuesday, his right leg in a cast and in crutches, Canning revealed he’s already utilizing his connections to best maneuver his recovery. “I’m good friends with Trayce Thompson, so he kinda connected me with his brother,” Canning told reporters in his usual calm demeanor. “It’s pretty early in the stages at this point. I have some questions, so I’m going to reach out to Klay (Thompson) for sure.” Klay, the\nDallas Mavericks\nshooting guard, knows what it feels like to have a promising season cut short by a devastating injury. He tore his ACL on his left knee in Game 6 of the 2019 NBA Finals, a game in which he led in scoring with 30 points. He tore his Achilles while attempting to come back the following season. Klay returned to the NBA after missing two seasons Canning left last Thursday’s game against the Atlanta Braves with a ruptured left Achilles tendon while breaking toward a grounder off the bat of shortstop Nick Allen to the left side of the infield. He was in the middle of a resurgent season, where he was 7-3 with a 3.77 ERA and 70 strikeouts in 16 starts. The win total and ERA represent career highs for the 29-year-old, and at that strikeout rate, he was on pace to set a high in strikeouts, too. “It sucks. I want to be out there with the guys,” Canning said. I mean, I just love baseball, so I think that’s probably the worst part, that I just don’t get to play for a while. Been doing some research, reading up on some of the basketball players who have had this.”\nMets moneyline is -130 on\nBetMGM\nfor Wednesday’s 1:10 PM game against the Brewers.

    "text": "TORONTO\n—\nYankees\nmanager Aaron Boone spent a good portion of his Tuesday pre-game media availability defending his shortstop. The night before, while the Blue Jays were staging a game-changing rally in a 5-4 win,\nAnthony Volpe\nmade a bad throw that added to alarming fielding numbers that rank dead last among American League shortstops, 11 errors with a .961 fielding percentage. The 2023 Gold Glove winner and 2024 Gold Glove finalist still is elite defender, Boone insisted even though the analytical numbers also show a drop-off, his minus-1 in Baseball Savant’s Outs Above Average and his plus-2 in Fan Graphs’ Defensive Runs Saved. “Moving forward, I think he’s an elite defensive shortstop,” Boone said. “That’s what he is. He’s made a few errors that he hasn’t typically made. It’s a few plays. “Nothing’s changed with who he is as a defender. Hopefully that levels out in the second half and it’s more in line. But the bottom line is he’s a playmaker out there and I expect that to continue.” As for Volpe’s offensive contributions, Boone pushed back hard on criticism here that’s been trending on X. “While everyone loses their mind about things, he’s a really good productive player,” Boone said. “Even offensively through some of his struggles this year, he’s a little better than league average performer at any position, let alone the shortstop position.” “We’re fortunate to have a really good one in Anthony Volpe. That doesn’t mean we don’t expect and want him to continue to get better and better. He’s 24. Everyone’s trajectories a little bit different. “You see late bloomers sometimes offensively. Sometimes you see a steady ascent. I think he’s a better offensive player now than he was last year and the year before, and hopefully that plays itself out the rest of the way.” Volpe then went out and had a bad Canada Day performance in another Yankees loss, this one\na 12-5 Blue Jays win\n. In five hitless at-bats, Volpe was at the plate three times with two runners on base and once with a man on second.\nThe total for Wednesday’s Yankees versus Blue Jays game is currently set at 8.5 on\nFanDuel\n. Our\nFanDuel Sportsbook review\nprovides a full guide on how to sign up and navigate through their site.\nHe’s now batting .225 for the season, .209 in 91 at-bats with runners in scoring position. Even his steals and stolen base percentage are down. All the while, Yankees’ No. 1 prospect\nGeorge Lombard Jr.\n, is a 20-year-old shortstop out of Gulliver Prep in Miami that’s already playing Double-A ball. He’s not tearing it up yet for the Somerset Patriots, but this son of a former big leaguer is holding his own competing with and against players who mostly are a few years older. While the Yankees continue to wait for Volpe to grow into the star player they think he’ll be, a lot of impatient fans are excited about Lombard, who could be their future shortstop or third baseman if he’s not traded away for potential instant gratification, which is very unlikely. “I’m hearing that Lombard is the closest thing to untouchable that the Yankees have in their system,” a veteran American League scout told NJ Advance Media on Tuesday. What should the Yankees do with Volpe? Who’s their shortstop of the future? The AL scout isn’t permitted by his club to talk about other organization’s players, but was willing to share his strong opinions after being granted anonymity. Who’s the better shortstop? “Lombard is a better fielder than Volpe,” the scout shot back. “The hands work better. The feet work better. Better arm, and it’s not even close. The timing is better. Lombard’s more fluid. His fielding is crisp, clean and absolutely outstanding.” What about Volpe? “Volpe is a second baseman, not a shortstop,” the scout said. What about Volpe winning a Gold Glove and being a finalist in his first two seasons? “Here’s what I have to say about Gold Gloves now,” the scout said. “Juan Soto was a Gold Glove finalist last year. Gold Gloves to me aren’t what they used to be. “Are you going to tell me Volpe was a better fielder than Gunnar Henderson or Bobby Witt in any of the last two seasons. He wasn’t. “I wouldn’t take Volpe over Witt, Henderson, Carlos Correa and a few others. I think Volpe is an average defender at best. I think the arm is below average, but he has good timing, so it’s just enough. “I just think Volpe is a better fit at second base. I’m not trying to be negative. I like Volpe as a player. I love him as an individual. I just think the New York Yankees need a better shortstop.” When Lombard is ready? “Yeah,” the scout said. “I think Lombard at shortstop with Volpe at second could be pretty damn good. But Lombard is at least a year away.  “This is his first taste in Double-A and he’s taking his lumps because he’s 20 years old. He needs to learn patience, but he’s fast tracking.” Why has Volpe struggled with the glove? “It seems like the game has sped up on him this year,” the scout said. “I feel like his timing was better last year.” What about Volpe’s hitting? His .712 OPS is up from .657 last year and .666 in 2023, but his .225 average is a big drop from last season’s .243 and his 24.9 strikeout rate is up from last season’s 22.6. “I’m seeing a little man trying to hit like Aaron Judge, and that’s not his game,” the scout said. “He used to be a gap to gap, but now he thinks he’s a power hitter. You can get away with that some at Yankee Stadium, but he’s striking out a ton and maybe will hit you 20 homers. Is that what you’re looking for. “Volpe can run. Why not be a gap-to-gap hitter like he was and possibly hit 15 homers instead of trying to be a mini–Aaron Judge?\" What’s the offensive potential of Lombard, who will represent the Yankees in this year’s Futures Game, which will be played in Atlanta on July 12, three days before the All-Star Game. “If we’re doing a 20/80 scale, it’s a 60 bat for Lombard,” the scout said. “This guy has a quick swing, he has bat speed and he’s strong. He’ll hit .260 and above. He’ll be a 20-plus homer guy.  “Defensively, I don’t know if he’ll win gold gloves, but he’ll be a plus defender.” So far this season, Lombard is hitting .209 with two homers in 48 Double-A after beginning the season with High-A Hudson Valley batting .329 with one homer in 24 games. Defensively, the 2024 first-round draft pick’s fielding numbers are very good: Four errors and a .981 fielding percentage in 59 games at shortstop plus no errors in six games at third base. Like the scout, Boone is a big fan of Lombard after seeing a lot of him this spring. “I’m super excited about George,” Boone said. “I think he’s going to be a really good player in this league ... a two-way player. Outstanding defender. Runs well. The bat keeps coming. He keeps getting better and better. You really notice the physicality of him. He’s 20 years old and you see that year-to year development.  “He loves the game. He works incredibly hard at it. He plays hard. He’s one of those guys that you want driving your culture. He’s that kind of special-makeup kid. “As advanced as he is defensively … he’s a special defender. In the spring we played him all over just to get him in there more often. He profiles as an outstanding defensive shortstop, but you just throw him over third and throw him over to second and he plays those positions like he’s been there all his life, too. “I can’t say enough good things about George Lombard Jr., honestly. I’m so excited for his future.”\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

    "text": "DEAR ERIC: My kiddo is hardworking, makes friends everywhere and is working on her third advanced degree. She is also working full time and volunteers at a shelter and her professional organization. She owns her house. My problem is her husband. He is not good enough for her. He has also been working on an advanced degree that took him five years to complete as he was “too anxious” to present his research findings. He does nothing around the house except cook (she has to clean up) and play video games on a very expensive set-up. He was in another state for a while for research and it took my kiddo and I an entire day to clean his office. The floor was covered with fast-food wrappers and trash. We found 15 pairs of sneakers. His field is sports-related but he does nothing physical as he has “old injuries”. She tells me he is a lot like me and that makes me furious. She says it makes him sad to know I don’t love him. She and I have had lots of talks about him as I have been too blunt on occasion. I told her that I would try to see him as she does but I just can’t seem to get past the fact he is lazy and entitled. I think it would be best if he and I sat down and talked but I am afraid he will go back to her with bad information. Please help me work through this. – Worried Mom DEAR MOM: Listen to what she’s actually telling you: she loves her husband, she loves you and your critiques are creating an issue where there isn’t one. Your laundry list of complaints about her husband are\nyour\ncomplaints, not hers. Yes, he has some growing to do. But I struggle to see what’s so egregious that your daughter should, what, get a divorce? We can express opinions to loved ones, respectfully and when asked for, but – absent conditions of neglect, abuse or illegal behavior – let people do what they want to do with their love lives. I don’t see anything that indicates your daughter is asking you for help out of this situation. In fact, it sounds like she’s having talks with you because your bluntness has become a problem. So, it’s not a good idea for you to sit down and talk with him. It doesn’t sound like you want to build a relationship with this person. It sounds like you want to excoriate him. Instead, start by respecting the choice that your daughter made and respecting the fact that you don’t know everything about what’s going on inside of this marriage. *** DEAR ERIC: I am writing after reading the letter about how to handle beautiful greeting cards you don’t want to just throw away (“Greeting Cards”). I’d love to suggest an option that, for me, is heartwarming. When I feel the love expressed, I turn the card over and on the back write a little note. Example: “Dear ___, you sent me this card on my 80th birthday and it touched my heart. Thank you. (personal note follows). Love Forever.” Then I place the card in a folder to be distributed to the sender when I pass away. I have an individual folder for each family member. It’s my hope that they’ll feel the love returned even after I am gone. – Feeling the Love DEAR LOVE: Oh wow! The foresight and creativity of this solution took my breath away. I simply adore this! You’ve created a sort of ouroboros of love, looping back on itself forever. Others suggested that children’s hospitals, senior centers and schools may have donation programs set up for repurposing old cards. And – important! – I used the term “throw out” in my original answer. Let me clarify: if you’re throwing the cards out, throw them in the recycling bin.\n(Send questions to R.

    "text": "PHILADELPHIA\n- Zack Wheeler has been one of the best pitchers in baseball since joining the Phillies prior to the 2020 season. He has been runner-up in the National League Cy Young voting twice and has also been a two-time All-Star. When National League rosters are announced on Sunday, it would be a shock - not to mention a travesty - if Wheeler didn’t make his third All-Star team. Considering his stature as one of baseball’s best pitchers and the fact this year’s All-Star Game is in his hometown of Atlanta, Wheeler would make sense as a potential All-Star Game starter. “Just being an All-Star in general is an honor,” said Wheeler after\npitching eight shutout innings in a 4-0 win over the San Diego Padres Monday\n. “I’ll let them figure that out.” The other obvious choice would be Pittsburgh phenom Paul Skenes, who started last year’s game as a rookie and along with Wheeler is a front-runner for this year’s Cy Young Award. Overall, Wheeler has an 8-3 record and 2.27 ERA. Skenes has a 4-7 record and 2.12 ERA. If the Pirates stay in rotation - no guarantee with two off days - Skenes would pitch the final day of the first half and be ineligible to pitch in the All-Star Game.  It would make plenty of sense, especially considering the Pirates are buried in the standings, to tweak the rotation so Skenes can appear in the Mid-Summer Classic as he is one of baseball’s biggest stars and doesn’t have many opportunities to showcase himself to the country playing for Pittsburgh. If the Phillies stay in rotation, Wheeler would pitch next Saturday, giving him two days off before a potential All-Star appearance or start. They could also adjust the rotation by having Wheeler pitch on his regular day, Friday - though that would require flip-flopping him with Ranger Suarez, who could also be an All-Star. Despite being selected twice, Wheeler’s All-Star appearances have been limited. He struck out the only batter he faced on three pitches in 2021 and didn’t go to the game last year because of a minor injury - though he was scheduled to pitch the Sunday before the game and wouldn’t have appeared any way. Suarez was injured last year and was not able to pitch in his first All-Star appearance. “I’ve said all along I hope all our guys make the All-Star team because it’s a great honor, and if they want to pitch, we’ll do everything we can to let them pitch,” said Phillies manager Rob Thomson. Wheeler is coming off a June that will likely earn him Pitcher of the Month honors. He allowed just two earned runs in 31 innings with 42 strikeouts, a month Thomson said was the best he’s ever seen from a pitcher he coached or managed.\nBill Evans can be reached at\nbevans@njadvancemedia.com\n.

    "text": "Rutgers University’s new president\nwill earn $1.45 million in salary and bonuses over the next year under a record-setting compensation package that also includes a historic house, a car and driver, and other perks that come with leading the state university.\nWilliam F. Tate IV\n— who started working for Rutgers on Tuesday — will make $\n1.1 million in base salary\nhis first year, according to his contract. Tate will be Rutgers’ highest-paid president ever. He will earn nearly $200,000 more a year in base salary alone when compared to his predecessor Jonathan Holloway, who officially stepped down from the job earlier this week. Holloway was earning $919,639 after five years as president, Rutgers officials said.  Tate will also top his own previous salary by more than 40%. In his last job at Louisiana State University, where Tate served as president for the past four years, his base pay was $750,000.  Tate agreed to a five-year deal with Rutgers, though the contract says he serves “at the pleasure of the Board of Governors.” That means there is no guarantee he will be asked to stay the full five years. Here are the key terms of Tate’s deal with Rutgers: Tate will be eligible for a performance bonus each year. In his first year on the job, he will receive the maximum bonus, taking home $352,000 on top of his base salary, according to his contract. In the following years, the board will evaluate his performance on goals set for him and the university to determine if his bonus will be a minimum of 10% of his base salary or a maximum of 32%. Many universities include deferred compensation clauses in their contracts. It is money presidents can collect if they stay in their posts a certain number of years. If Tate stays at Rutgers for five years, he will receive an additional $1.875 million in deferred compensation on top of his regular salary and bonuses, according to his contract. That is $375,000 per year of employment.  Tate and his wife, author Kim Cash Tate, will live in the nearly 100-year-old, 14,000-square-foot Rutgers president’s residence. All of the public spaces in the Piscataway house are furnished by Rutgers and staff will be provided for cleaning, groundskeeping and maintenance.  Tate will also be provided everything he needs to have a state-of-the-art home office, according to his contract.  Rutgers is also paying all “reasonable costs” related to the Tate family’s move to New Jersey from Baton Rouge.  Tate will receive $15,000 annually for a vehicle, his contract says. If he choses to lease a car, he could afford something similar to a new\nBMW SUV\n, which can run about $1,000 a month. He will also have access to a university driver for Rutgers-related travel.  If Tate travels for work, his wife’s travel will also be covered by Rutgers. If needed, the university will cover up to $20,000 in attorney’s fees “incurred by him in connection with the process related to his appointment as President,” his deal says. There are several other benefits listed in Tate’s contract, including: Though Tate’s pay is the highest-ever at the state university, he will not be the highest-paid person at Rutgers. That honor usually goes to coaches, including head football coach Greg Schiano, who earned $6.25 million last year, and head basketball coach Steve Pikiell, who took home $3.25 million, according to\nan NJ Advance Media analysis\npublished last year. It is unclear where Tate’s pay will rank among other public college presidents around the nation this year. An analysis of 2023 college presidents’ pay by\nThe Chronicle of Higher Education\nfound Renu Khator, chancellor of University of Houston, was the highest paid public higher education leader that year, earning over $1.9 million in total compensation.\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

    "text": "The five-lined skink is the only native New Jersey lizard that is found throughout the state. (Two others, the brown skink and fence lizard, are found only in the southern part of the state.) In North America, this reptile is widespread, ranging from southern Ontario to the Gulf Coast and west to the Great Plains. The favored habitat is a forested area with some moisture, a lot of ground cover in the form of rotten logs and woody debris, and with places in which to bask in the sun. Old, abandoned buildings, long-established woodpiles and log dumps are suitable. In northern New Jersey, skinks are an unexpected but not unlikely sight in rocky areas such as talus slopes, where loose boulders provide shelter and nest sites. It is unlikely to be seen in suburbia.  It’s not a big animal and it’s easy to recognize. Adults range from five to eight inches long, about half of which is tail. The body in juveniles is dark brown to black, shiny, with five longitudinal white stripes and a blue tail, giving the species the alternate name of blue-tailed skink. The blue color and the stripes fade with age, more so in males than females. Old males (which are rarely seen – it’s a tough world out there for a small lizard) may be uniformly brown, with a reddish-orange throat and face during breeding season.  Five-lined skinks eat insects, spiders, earthworms, amphibians including salamanders and small frogs, and occasionally smaller lizards, baby birds, and even the eggs of small birds. Like many lizards, five-lined skinks can drop their tails when pursued by a predator. The severed tail continues to move, diverting the chase while the tailless individual escapes. The tail will regrow but will be shorter and not as flexible as the original. These lizards are territorial, with males defending their spaces from other males but tolerating juveniles and females. It has been suggested that the blue tail color facilitates recognition by males of these non-competitors or possible mates. The mating season is in the springtime, and the six to 18 thin-shelled eggs are laid about one month after mating, in sheltered locations beneath rotting logs or other debris, or in rock crevices in which some organic debris has accumulated. Freshly laid eggs are oval and about half an inch long. Incubation time varies with temperature, and can be anything from 25 to 50 days. The females brood the eggs, defending them from small predators and maintaining moisture levels by covering them with soil or urinating on them. The baby skinks leave the nest a few days after hatching, when they are about two inches long, and with great luck might live to be six years old.\nFor information about the Gloucester County Nature Club, see\ngcnatureclub.org/\n.",

    "text": "The Oklahoma City Thunder just won the NBA championship with a “Big 3″ of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren. Two of the three -- Williams and Holmgren -- were drafted by the Thunder, and all three are considered the core of a team that could win multiple rings in the coming years. The San Antonio Spurs hope to take a page out of Oklahoma City’s book with a young “Big 3″ of their own -- and that trio features Victor Wembanyama, Steph Castle and ex-Rutgers star\nDylan Harper.\nWembanyama and Castle are the last two Rookies of the Year in the league, and Harper could contend for the award next season along with No. 1 overall pick\nCooper Flagg\nof the Dallas Mavericks and former Rutgers teammate\nAce Bailey\n, the No. 5 pick of the Utah Jazz, among others. “The Spurs think that this could be their trio that they drafted in a row, Victor Wembanyama, then Stephon Castle, now Dylan Harper,” ESPN’s Brian Windhorst said Tuesday night on air.  “They backed it up with some other veterans that they brought in around them, but this is what they’re excited about. And if you look at what’s happened in Dallas, just up the road in Texas, look at Cooper Flagg. These three teams are all drafting and all trying to build the same way [as] their Southwest Division rivals [the Thunder] as well.”  ESPN’s\nPaul Biancardi\npraised Harper -- who set a Rutgers freshman scoring record with 564 points last season -- as a “bigger, stronger’ version of\nKnicks\n’ All-Star point guard Jalen Brunson. “Dylan Harper plays like a bigger, stronger Jalen Brunson,” Biancardi told NJ Advance Media. “He navigates the ball screen with scoring ability and a keen understanding of reading the coverage and help defense.  “He plays effectively off two feet as he approaches the basket, finds the open pocket of space for his mid-range shot, and knows when to accelerate and decelerate.” Before being drafted No. 2 overall by the Spurs, Harper appeared on SportsCenter and talked about what it would be like to join Wembanyama, Castle, De’Aaron Fox and the Spurs. “I mean, that would definitely be great and I would definitely be blessed to have that opportunity just because they’re two young players, young stars, and the rest of the team from top to bottom is really good so when you get to play with better players and the best of the best, it just brings out your best game,” Harper said.\nThe Spurs are +700 to win the Southwest division next season on\nDraftKings\n. Our complete\nDraftKings Sportsbook review\nshows you how to sign up and use their platform.\nFormer NBA player Tim Legler believes the Spurs have a young nucleus capable of challenging for a spot in the Play-In Tournament this year, and doing some real damage in the rugged Western Conference in years to come. “This team could potentially be in the mix for the Play-In if everybody stays healthy,” he said. “This season.”\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

    "text": "The\nBattleship New Jersey\nbecame a floating shooting range as dozens of competitors fired at clay targets soaring over the Delaware River last week. Shot after shot rang out from the deck of the historic ship on the Camden waterfront Thursday as competitors shattered thousands of discs during an unconventional fundraising event. For the first time, the Battleship New Jersey Museum and Memorial hosted a clay shooting competition aboard the nation’s most decorated and fastest Navy warship. The idea took shape earlier this year as museum leaders searched for new ways to raise money following state funding cuts. “We wanted to create something bold, memorable, and completely unique to the Battleship,” Marshall Spevak, CEO of the Battleship New Jersey said in a statement. “There’s nothing else like it in the country — shooting clays from the deck of a battleship while supporting a living piece of American history.” What began as a single concept — one shooting station and a single trap machine — quickly expanded. After a few planning meetings, organizers decided to close the ship to the public for the day and go all in. “After the third meeting, they said, ‘We’re going to close the ship down for this event. How can we get the most shooting possible?’” said Joe Pancoast, owner of\nCedar Creek Sporting Clays\n. The fundraising event was held in partnership with Cedar Creek Sporting Clays, a professional shooting course based in Cumberland County that specializes in sporting clay events. Eighty competitors, from seasoned sportsmen and enthusiasts to military veterans, packed the ship’s deck by midday. Divided into 20 teams, they cycled through eight shooting stations as 12 trap machines launched more than 5,000 clay targets into the sky. To ensure the event was environmentally safe, shooters used shotgun shells loaded with steel shot and paper wads. “Everything that went into the river was biodegradable,” Pancoast said. The top team walked away with a custom-made trophy crafted from the ship’s decking. The competition was held aboard the newly repaired and freshly painted Battleship New Jersey, which returned to its home dock in Camden last year following a 12-week,\n$10 million restoration project\n. Known as “Big J,” the USS New Jersey is the most decorated, fastest and longest battleship in Navy history.  It was commissioned in 1942 and served in World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and the Cold War before being decommissioned in 1991. Since 2001, it has been operating as a museum on the Camden waterfront.  Participants called the shooting event unlike anything the ship has ever hosted — a rare opportunity for both shooters and spectators that could now become an annual event. “It was a day of competition, connection, and community — and we look forward to making this an annual tradition,\" Spevak said.\nOur journalism needs your support.

    "text": "Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms are in the forecast for most of New Jersey today followed by another round of afternoon thunderstorms Thursday. But once the storms are done,\nthe Fourth of July weekend forecast\nlooks promising.  Scattered light rain and thunderstorms are possible through midday today, primarily for the southern half of New Jersey.  “We will have a split forecast today across the region,” the National Weather Service said.  “North and west of the I-95 corridor will be cloudy to start, but drier, sunnier, and warmer by the afternoon with highs in the upper 80s,” the weather service said “South and east, we will still see lingering showers and a few thunderstorms through the morning and into the early afternoon, leading to more clouds and cooler temperatures with highs in the low 80s.” High humidity will persist until the front moves offshore. Any afternoon thunderstorms may produce heavy downpours but are not expected to become severe. By Thursday, another cold front will cross the region, potentially triggering isolated thunderstorms, mainly northwest of I-95.  These storms could produce localized damaging wind gusts and small hail. Temperatures will remain in the mid to upper 80s, with humidity levels dropping significantly. The Fourth of July forecast looks ideal, with sunny skies and temperatures in the low to mid 80s.  Both Friday and Saturday will continue the pleasant weather pattern, featuring dry conditions and comfortable temperatures.  By Sunday, temperatures will climb to near 90 degrees with increasing humidity. Early next week, more unsettled weather is expected, with daily chances of showers and thunderstorms and temperatures potentially reaching near 90 degrees.  Rip current risks remain moderate today, with breaking wave heights of 1-3 feet along the New Jersey coastline.\nGenerative AI was used to produce an initial draft of this story, which was reviewed and edited by NJ Advance Media staff.",

    "text": "Democrat\nMikie Sherrill\nleads Republican\nJack Ciattarelli\nby 20 percentage points in the first major general-election poll in\nNew Jersey’s big governor’s race\n, released about four months to Election Day. The\nRutgers-Eagleton Poll\n, out Wednesday, found President\nDonald Trump\nlooms heavily as voters pick a new governor to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov.\nPhil Murphy\n. But the gap between the two nominees narrows on economic issues and 1-in-5 independent voters are undecided, according to the survey. The poll shows 51% of Jerseyans would pick Sherrill, a U.S. congresswoman, if the Nov. 4 election were today.  That’s compared to 31% who’d back Ciattarelli, a former member of the state Assembly and the GOP nominee who lost to Murphy by a narrow margin\nin a closer-than-expected race four years ago\n.  When residents who lean toward a candidate are added, Sherrill leads Ciattarelli 56% to 35%. Meanwhile, 5% say they support neither candidate or someone else and 13% are unsure.  The survey was conducted a few days after Sherrill and Ciattarelli emerged with their parties’ nominations in\nthe June 10 primary\n. The figures paint a wider gap between Sherrill and Ciattarelli than many political insiders and experts\nhave been expecting\n. Ashley Koning, director of the\nEagleton Center for Public Interest Polling\nat\nRutgers University-New Brunswick\n, said in a statement that “early polling on the governor’s race should serve as a baseline or a barometer of how voters are feeling in the moment — not as some crystal ball predicting the future four months from now.\"  “A lot can happen between now and November, and we know this gap will very likely narrow in the next several months,” Koning added. “We only need to look back to 2021 to see how much a race can change throughout a cycle. Add to this an intense national political landscape that will, once again, surely play a role in the governor’s race here at home. Come November, what will matter is who actually turns out to vote.” For reference,\na Rutgers-Eagleton poll\njust before the 2021 primaries showed Murphy leading Ciattarelli by 26 points. Murphy ended up beating him by about 3. The poll shows 52% of residents say Trump is a “major factor” in their vote, 18% say he’s a “minor” one, and 30% say he isn’t one at all. Sherrill supporters are more likely to say the Republican president is a major factor, while 48% of independents say the same. Trump\nendorsed Ciattarelli\n, a\nformer critic\n, in the GOP primary. Sherrill has\nrepeatedly tied him\nto the president in a blue-leaning state where registered Democratic voters outnumber registered Republicans by about 800,000, though Trump\nreduced his margin of loss\nin the state last year. “Trump’s influence appears to be more of a benefit to Sherrill right now, given key groups more likely to support her are also more likely to claim the president is a factor in their vote choice, while those more supportive of Ciattarelli do not,” Koning said. “While Trump’s endorsement may have helped in the primaries, these numbers are an early sign that the endorsement may play differently when it comes to the general.”  The poll shows Jerseyans are split on who would better handle taxes: 39% say Sherrill, 34% Ciattarelli, 14% neither, and 14% unsure.  On who’s better to handle cost of living and affordability, 45% say Sherrill, 29% Ciattarelli, 13% neither, and 13% are uncertain. As for other big issues:  Democrats and Republicans tend to side with their nominees on those issues, but it’s a toss-up for independents on the economy, taxes, cost of living and affordability, and crime and safety. Sherrill leads with independents on education and schools (46% to 19%), health care (45% to 16%), and transportation and infrastructure (40% to 23%). Ciattarelli strategist Chris Russell sharply\ncriticized the survey\non social media, calling it a “steaming pile of s**t.” He argued the methodology over-represented Murphy and\nKamala Harris\nand Murphy supporters. Koning, the poll’s director, pushed back. “Our scientifically grounded methodology follows best practices in the survey research industry,” she said in a statement. “Polls are still the most reliable, systematic, and scientific tool for assessing public opinion.” The poll also found: The statewide poll was conducted via phone with 621 New Jersey adults — including 579 registered voters — from June 13-16. The margin of error was plus-or-minus 5.4 percentage points.\nThank you for relying on us to provide the local news you can trust.

    "text": "IF JULY 2 IS YOUR BIRTHDAY:\nIn a couple of weeks, you may have a prime window for seizing opportunities, making key decisions, and gaining recognition, as your sound judgment and long-range vision are likely at their peak. Consider launching major ventures for a good chance at success. Social events may fill your calendar, and while you might be busier than usual, group activities and networking could reveal unexpected rewards. In August, tread carefully—an impulsive choice could disrupt your peace of mind. The latter half of September is ideal for rest, though a few days may financial decisions or new investments. Be cautious not to overlook details or fall for strategies designed to drain your resources. Your leadership and enthusiasm may shine in early October but resist the urge to make sudden changes. By late October, your romantic energy is strong—a weekend getaway could bring your dreams to life.\nCANCER\n(June 21-July 22): Some people only learn the hard way and may ignore advice. Those you’re dealing with may be set in their ways or act unpredictably, patience will be key. Notice if a few of your own choices don’t align with sound judgment, either.\nLEO\n(July 23-Aug. 22): Trust your instincts and stay alert. Consider when to follow the rules and when to forge your own path. Quick thinking can help you sidestep potential problems. Avoid risky moves, even if ideas seem exciting or you’re eager to please someone.\nVIRGO\n(Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Clear up rumors or doubts by addressing them directly. Ignoring misunderstandings or brushing issues aside could lead to still more confusion. Caution is your best ally, someone’s hidden agenda may be working against your own.\nLIBRA\n(Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Looking toward the weekend, social events with fun-loving people may be on your mind. Business strategies and financial planning might take up much of your time, but you may still want to find space for romance.\nSCORPIO\n(Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Impulsive decisions may have worked for you in the past, but circumstances may have shifted. Now, deeper research is likely needed to achieve similar success. Things will improve even more once you fully understand how everything works.\nSAGITTARIUS\n(Nov. 22-Dec. 21): If you feel grouped into a stereotype, think about ways to stand out. On the flip side, someone close to you—possibly through work—could surprise you by being refreshingly authentic, original, and a true nonconformist.\nCAPRICORN\n(Dec. 22-Jan. 19): You may hesitate to support a cause due to a packed schedule. Hold off on launching new projects or fundraising efforts until the timing feels right. A family member or colleague could disrupt your plans with unexpected actions or words.\nAQUARIUS\n(Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Ideas may begin to dawn after a night, or a few nights, of mental fog. If you feel ready to act on your thoughts, start moving toward your goals. Take full advantage of today’s mental clarity to assess and firm up plans.\nPISCES\n(Feb. 19-March 20): Be mindful of your limits, especially when it comes to money. Without discipline, you could overspend or agree to something you might regret. Dream big but focus on goals that are within reach. Don’t let small frustrations lead to overreactions.\nARIES\n(March 21-April 19): You might feel sharper than those around you, but this attitude may not sit well with family members. Your worldly insight may make you an expert in some areas, but it won’t necessarily help you build harmony at home.\nTAURUS\n(April 20-May 20): Something new or unexpected may catch your attention or tempt you to slack off today. Disconnect from social media and emails until your tasks are complete. Save social time for later to stay focused and productive.\nGEMINI\n(May 21-June 20): Keep your spending in check, as quality items or real bargains may be hard to find. It might be tempting to buy something just to feel like you’re getting a deal. You could feel financially stretched or limited by your current budget.\nBIRTHDAY STAR:\nActor Nelson Franklin was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on this date in 1985.

    "text": "Editor’s note:\nThis story\nwas originally published by\nNJ Spotlight News\nand shared as part of a content-sharing agreement between\nMosaic.NJ.com\nand NJ Spotlight News. You can follow them on\nFacebook\nand\nTwitter (or X).\nCommunity-based violence intervention programs are a key component in reducing and preventing gun violence across the state, advocates, academics and state officials say. No statewide data points to a direct correlation between a reduction in homicide rates and the work of these programs. But recent data from the state shows the programs have contributed significantly to a reduction in the number of people who were shot across New Jersey. In 2023, 924 people were shot in the state, a 13% reduction compared to 2022, according to a recent\nreport from the attorney general’s office\n. Last year, 788 people were shot, further reducing the number of shooting victims in New Jersey, the report says. Fatal shootings are down 40% in New Jersey over the last four years, and in the past two years the state has seen the total number of shootings “reach an all-time low,” Attorney General Matthew Platkin said in a statement to NJ Spotlight News. “These substantial decreases can be attributed to a multi-pronged approach that builds upon the courageous and dedicated work of our law enforcement officers to also include over $120 million of investments in community violence intervention — programming that puts trained professionals at critical points of intervention like the hospital bedside and on the streets, preventing further violence and victimization,” Platkin said. But community-based violence intervention programs in New Jersey and across the country have had to\nlay off employees and in some cases end services\naltogether after the U.S. Department of Justice abruptly canceled hundreds of ongoing grants in April. That work is being reduced or shuttered altogether as the region prepares for excessive heat.\nCrime increases and shootings occur more often when temperatures rise\noutside, academics and researchers have noted. By taking away funding from these organizations and leading to their collapse, the federal government is also now taking away the little bit of trust these organizations may have helped to build with other institutional structures or organizations, including local hospitals, Jason Williams, a professor of justice studies at Montclair State University, said. “This is going to have a colossal effect and all kinds of collateral consequences that I don’t even think people are really seeing or talking about right now,” said Williams. On Tuesday, Platkin, along with 21 attorneys general and the state of Pennsylvania,\nfiled a multistate lawsuit\nchallenging the Trump administration’s “illegal attempts” to end federal funding to states for a wide variety of programs, including those combating violent crime, according to a press release from the New Jersey attorney general’s office. Community violence intervention and prevention services provide\npeer support\n, counseling,\nmentorship\nand conflict mediation. The goal is to improve people’s lives in neighborhoods where violence is common. The programs promote positive behavioral change and reduce the likelihood that people who are victims of community violence will commit or promote violence themselves. And the programs work, say the experts who study them and the people whose lives have been changed by them. In a recent interview with NJ Spotlight News, Racquel Romans-Henry of Salvation and Social Justice said violence disruption teams are “so important” during summer because the programs offer outlets and resources to young people. “It gives us access to the communities in a way that we may not have access to in other parts of the year when people tend to be indoors. And quite frankly, the need is incredibly great,” said Romans-Henry, the director of policy for the Trenton-based nonprofit. Salvation and Social Justice runs the\nTrenton Restorative Street Team\n, which provides violence prevention and intervention programming through education and advocacy, among other offerings. “More than ever, I think the support of these teams is crucial,” said Romans-Henry. “One of the things we continue to advocate for is not just increased state support, but increased local and county support for these crisis response teams and using cannabis dollars to support those teams as well,” Romans-Henry said. Gov. Phil Murphy’s budget proposal for the fiscal year that begins July 1 includes $25.5 million in revenues from marijuana sales to support hospital and community-based violence intervention programs, according to a\nstate budget document\n. Providers of community-based violence intervention programs across the state responded to a total of 688 violent incidents in 2024, according to Tara Oliver, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office. Other programs working to prevent and reduce violence this summer include the\nPaterson Healing Collective, a hospital-based violence intervention program\nin Passaic County. The healing collective pairs medical staff at St. Joseph’s University Medical Center in Paterson with community members who have built trusting relationships with their peers to\nmentor victims of gun violence\n— many of whom are young men of color — and limit retaliation among them. Earlier this month, the Paterson Healing Collective hosted its fourth annual Paterson Healing Fest concert in the city. The event, which included live music and free food, took place on “Wear Orange” weekend, a national effort spearheaded by the Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund “to\nhonor survivors of gun violence and\ndemand a future free from gun violence.” Around 500 people attended, according to Liza Chowdhury, executive director of the Paterson Healing Collective and Reimagining Justice Inc. The day after the event, June 8, the healing collective began its second annual\n“Summer Peace Challenge,”\naccording to Casey Melvin, the director of both field operations and the crisis response team for the collective. The challenge encourages every neighborhood in the city, especially those considered to be high-crime areas, to take part in a 90-day contest to lower the number of gun violence incidents and to push for a summer free from shootings and homicides. The top three neighborhoods that have no gun violence or have the least amount of gun violence by the end of the 90 days will win a block party in their section of the city, according to Melvin. “The community believes in us and we’re a trusted agency,” Melvin said in a recent interview with NJ Spotlight News. “The more support we receive, the better we’ll do because our end goal is to end gun violence as the slogan for National Wear Orange Day states.” The Paterson Healing Collective is “so effective” because staff members are from the community and are “familiar faces” who are going to a hospital bedside after a person has been shot, according to Chowdhury. Rahshon Dixon is one of those staff members that visits gunshot victims at St. Joseph’s University Medical Center. Dixon said in a recent interview that gunshot victims often face depression after surviving the experience. “We leave a card, we’ll take their information and give them our information,” Dixon, a safety planning coordinator at the healing collective, said of the hospital visits. The healing collective offers one-on-one and group mental health counseling to gunshot victims, along with many other services, Dixon said. Providers of hospital-based violence intervention programs worked with over 2,500 people affected by violence in 2024, according to the attorney general’s office. Violent crime rates and homicide rates have also been down nationally and in New Jersey over the last couple of years due in part to “historic investments” made by the Biden administration and states putting money into violence prevention, according to Daniel Semenza, an associate professor at Rutgers University. “Community violence intervention and the adjacent hospital-based violence intervention has been a big part of that investment over the last couple of years,” said Semenza, who also serves as the director of research at the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center. Semenza noted that violence has decreased at some of the fastest rates nationally since homicide data started being recorded. However, he said his biggest concern is the reversal of these positive trends due to the federal funding cuts that happened in April. “The news that is currently still coming out — the quarterly news that you might see from something like the\nReal-Time Crime Index\nthat is tracking homicide rates on a monthly, quarterly basis — it’s still good news,” said Semenza. “It’s still showing drops in violence throughout the state and throughout the country, but there’s always going to be a lag.” “My fear is that now in the summer, when there’s a little bit more of a lag time, we might start to see the implications of these funding cuts,” Semenza said.\nWelcome to Mosaic.

    "text": "A multi-bus crash that injured 17 people, closed part of the busy Port Authority Bus terminal and caused delays at the Lincoln Tunnel during the height of the Wednesday morning rush hour.  Port Authority officials said police responded to a crash between three NJ Transit buses at 6:15 a.m. Twelve people sustained minor injuries, and one person was transported to the hospital for further evaluation.  An alert said the crash happened on the third floor of the bus terminal. An investigation is underway to determine the cause of the incident. NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri said 15 passengers and two employees had minor injuries.  Port Authority alerts said the crash has caused 30 minute Lincoln Tunnel delays to New York. The Route 495 express bus lane (XBL) ramp closed, and all bus traffic has been rerouted to the upper level of the terminal. The XBL reopened at 9:38 a.m. The crash caused NJ Transit buses traveling to and from the Port Authority Bus Terminal to be diverted to Secaucus Junction, Newark Penn Station and Hoboken Terminal. All trains will stop at Secaucus.  NJ Transit bus tickets and passes are being cross-honored by NJ Transit rail, on New York Waterway ferries at Port Imperial and by PATH at Hoboken, Newark Penn Station and 33rd Street New York. However trains also experienced a 20 minute delay to and from Penn Station New York due to an earlier disabled NJ Transit train, according to an alert.\nOur journalism needs your support.
